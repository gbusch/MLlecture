You need python with numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and scikit-learn installed.
The easiest is to install Anaconda (python 3 version) which should include all important packages. Otherwise they can be easily installed by e.g. "conda install scikit-learn". Anaconda is available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS.
